Suggested Non-Functional Requirements for Intraday Risk System

## Performance
1. Latency: The system must initiate risk runs within 100 milliseconds of receiving a trade update or a scheduled trigger.
2. Throughput: The system must support processing up to 10,000 trade updates per second while maintaining consistent performance.
3. Scalability: The system must handle a 200% increase in trade update volume during peak trading periods without degradation.

## Availability
4. Uptime: The system must maintain 99.99% availability during trading hours (e.g., 8 AM - 8 PM).
5. Failover: The system must provide automatic failover to a backup instance within 30 seconds in case of primary instance failure.

## Reliability
6. Error Handling: The system must detect and recover from failed risk runs automatically without human intervention.
7. Data Integrity: All trades and risk run results must be accurately stored and retrieved without loss or corruption.

## Scalability
8. Horizontal Scaling: The system must be capable of adding new nodes to handle increased trade volumes or additional trading desks.
9. Future Expansion: The architecture must allow for easy integration with new risk engines or trading platforms.

## Maintainability
10. Monitoring: The system must provide detailed logs and metrics for risk run performance, system health, and error rates.
11. Configurability: Scheduled run intervals and trade update processing rules must be configurable without requiring a system restart.
12. Code Quality: All code must meet the bank’s standards for test coverage (e.g., 90%) and include comprehensive documentation.

## Security
13. Authentication and Authorization: The system must enforce strict access controls to ensure only authorized users and components can initiate risk runs or access data.
14. Encryption: All trade data and risk results must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

## Resilience
15. Fault Tolerance: The system must be able to handle the failure of individual components (e.g., trade stream subscription, risk engine) without affecting overall functionality.
16. Trade Replay: In the event of a failure, the system must support replaying missed trade updates within 1 minute of recovery.

## Compliance
17. Auditability: The system must log all trade updates, risk runs, and configuration changes with timestamps for audit purposes.
18. Regulatory Reporting: The system must meet any applicable regulations for data storage and processing (e.g., MiFID II, GDPR).

## Usability
19. Dashboard: Provide a real-time dashboard for traders to view the status of risk runs and monitor pending or failed tasks.
20. Alerts: Automatically notify relevant stakeholders (e.g., traders, IT support) of failures, delays, or anomalies in risk runs.

These NFRs aim to ensure the system is performant, robust, and aligned with the operational needs of a trading desk. Let me know if you’d like to refine or expand on any of these points!
