## Usage

Browse to the relevant directory and examine the code samples. Each major section may contain its own README with additional context.

To use a sample:
1. Navigate to the appropriate directory
2. Review the code and any local documentation
3. Copy/adapt the code to your target project
4. Modify as needed for your specific use case

## Quick Reference

| Need | Location | Files |
|------|----------|-------|
| Angular dialog component | `angular/components/` | `submit-dialog.ts`, `submit-dialog.spec.ts` |
| .NET structured logging | `elastic/WebApplication/` | `Program.cs`, `appsettings.json` |
| Mock Elastic server | `elastic/FakeElasticServer/` | `main.py` |
| Docker multi-service setup | `docker-compose/` | `docker-compose.yml` |
| Selenium automation | `selenium/` | `*.ipynb` |

## Contributing

This is a personal reference repository. Feel free to add new samples in appropriate directories:
- Create technology-specific folders as needed
- Include brief comments explaining the purpose
- Add tests if the sample demonstrates testing patterns
- Update this README when adding new major samples

## Notes

- Samples may not be production-ready without modification
- Check dependencies and versions before using in production projects
- Some samples may be experiments or work-in-progress
